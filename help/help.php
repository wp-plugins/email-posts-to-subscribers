		<p>The aim of this plugin is One Time Configuration and Life Time Newsletter to subscribers.

		<h3>What are all the steps to do after plugin activation?</h3>
		
		<strong>Step 1: Checking Templates</strong>
		<p>After installing Email posts to subscriber plugin on your blogs, verifying a template would be your first step, because design is very important for newsletters. Go to Templates menu and preview the default templates. If you think the default templates are not interested, click Add New button to create your own theme.

		<strong>Step 2: Mail Configuration</strong>
		<p>This is an important section in this plugin. Here you have option to select the design and post categories for the newsletters, so that newsletter will be generated automatically based on this input. Also in this section you have option to set number of emails per page (Number of emails per shot).

		<strong>Step 3: Preview Your Newsletter</strong>

		<strong>Step 5: Schedule Mail</strong>
		<p>I have plan to add WordPress Schedule (WP_CRON) feature in the next release. At present i strongly recommend you to use your server CRON job (cPanel or Plesk) to send your newsletters. The following link explains how to create a CRON job through the cPanel or Plesk. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2014/03/28/wordpress-plugin-email-posts-to-subscribers/">click here</a></p>
